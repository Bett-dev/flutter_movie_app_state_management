# ðŸŽ¬ Movie App State Management Comparison

This repo contains the same movie app built using three different state management techniques in Flutter:

- âœ… `movie_app_provider_mvvm`
- âœ… `movie_app_riverpod_mvvm`
- âœ… `movie_app_bloc_mvvm`

Each app uses the MVVM architecture and showcases clean separation of UI, state, and data.

This project serves as a technical comparison of three major state management approaches in Flutter.
